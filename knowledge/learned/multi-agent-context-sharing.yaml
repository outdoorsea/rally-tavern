context: Rally Tavern development
lesson: |
  When multiple agents work on related tasks, they need shared context.
  Without it, agents duplicate work or make conflicting decisions.
solution: |
  Use Rally Tavern gossip for ephemeral shared context.
  Use knowledge/ for permanent collective intelligence.
  Include context field in bounties with relevant intel.
references:
  - Gas Town hooks for persistent agent state
  - Beads for work tracking
