context: |
  Two polecats were assigned to refactor a large codebase.
  Both ended up editing the same files, causing merge conflicts
  and lost work.

stop:
  - Assigning broad "refactor this module" tasks to multiple agents
  - Using vague task boundaries
  - Letting agents choose their own files to edit

start:
  - Explicitly listing which files each agent owns
  - Using file-level locking or claim system
  - Having Mayor coordinate file assignments before spawning polecats
  - Adding "do not edit" lists to agent instructions

continue:
  - Breaking large refactors into small, focused beads
  - Using atomic commits for each logical change
  - Code review before merging agent work

outcome: |
  After implementing file ownership: zero merge conflicts
  in the next 50 multi-agent tasks.
