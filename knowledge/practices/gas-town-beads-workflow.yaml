summary: |
  Best practices for using Beads with Gas Town for multi-agent work.
details: |
  1. Use hash-based IDs (bd-abc12) to prevent merge conflicts
  2. Set issue_prefix per rig to namespace beads
  3. Use bd ready to find unblocked work
  4. Claim atomically with bd claim before starting
  5. Use hooks for persistent state across sessions
gotchas:
  - Don't use hyphens in rig names (use underscores)
  - Dolt server must be running for full persistence
  - Compact old beads periodically to save context
